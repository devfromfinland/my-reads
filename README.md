# MyReads Project

This is the Project #1 for Udacity's React Nanodegree Program. The codes forked from its starter repository at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter. Backend server is provided by Udacity with the ['BooksAP.js'] to retrieve data on the backend.

GitHub link to my project is pushed and submitted at: https://github.com/devfromfinland/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

To start reviewing:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Note
There might be some warning when run npm. It might be because of mixing npm and yarn package managers from different workspaces
